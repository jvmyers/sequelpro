Did that; found nothing.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I frequently hand edit lines in my MariaDB, and, due to some as-yet-unidentified action on my part, SequelPro automatically adds a new, blank line to the end of the table!!!  In just the past 1 hour of such work, your tool auto-added 4 NEW lines: now I must export the table, delete these lines, and import the cleaned table; I do not have time to waste un-doing things that never should have been done in the first place.  Stupid!

I find this behavior to be insulting and extremely disrupting; I am fully capable of adding a new line when I need one - I do NOT need your tool thinking for me (Microsoft and Apple are committed to the concept that their users are brain-dead and NEED someone else to think for them - you do not need to emulate them!).  Please make this "feature" optional, then document how to turn it OFF.  If such a mechanism already exists, PLEASE direct me to the relevant instructions.
